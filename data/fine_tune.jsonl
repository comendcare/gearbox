The TOPAZ-1 trial evaluated durvalumab plus chemotherapy for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer. METHODS In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer or with recurrent disease 1:1 to receive durvalumab or placebo in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin for up to eight cycles, followed by durvalumab or placebo monotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective was to assess overall survival. Secondary end points included progression-free survival, objective response rate, and safety. RESULTS Overall, 685 patients were randomly assigned to durvalumab (n5341) or placebo (n5344) with chemotherapy. As of data cutoff, 198 patients (58.1%) in the durvalumab group and 226 patients (65.7%) in the placebo group had died. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.97; P50.021). The estimated 24-month overall survival rate was 24.9% (95% CI, 17.9 to 32.5) for durvalumab and 10.4% (95% CI, 4.7 to 18.8) for placebo. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.89; P50.001). Objective response rates were 26.7% with durvalumab and 18.7% with placebo. The incidences of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 75.7% and 77.8% with durvalumab and placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Durvalumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival versus placebo plus chemotherapy and showed improvements versus placebo plus chemotherapy in prespecified secondary end points including progression-free survival and objective response rate. The safety profiles of the two treatment groups were similar. (Funded by AstraZeneca; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03875235.)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this summary about? This is a summary describing the results of a Phase III study called TOPAZ-1. The study looked at treatment with durvalumab (a type of immunotherapy) and chemotherapy to treat participants with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). Advanced BTC is usually diagnosed at late stages of disease, when it cannot be cured by surgery. This study included participants with advanced BTC who had not received previous treatment, or had their cancer come back at least 6 months after receiving treatment or surgery that aimed to cure their disease. Participants received treatment with durvalumab and chemotherapy or placebo and chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to find out if treatment with durvalumab and chemotherapy could increase the length of time that participants with advanced BTC lived, compared with placebo and chemotherapy.What were the results of the study? Participants who took durvalumab and chemotherapy had a 20% lower chance of experiencing death at any point in the study compared with participants who received placebo and chemotherapy. The side effects experienced by participants were similar across treatment groups, and less than 12% of participants in either treatment group had to stop treatment due to treatment-related side effects.What do the results of the study mean? Overall,  these  results  support  durvalumab  and  chemotherapy  as  a  new  treatment option for people with advanced BTCs. Based on the results of this study, durvalumab is now approved for the treatment of adults with advanced BTCs in combination with chemotherapy by government organizations in Europe, the United States and several other countries."}]}

Diarrhea management recommendations\nBased on the diarrhea management plan initiated during the LAVENDER trial, a set of recommendations is proposed (Table 2) and described below. For the purpose of these recommendations, diarrhea is defined as any softening of stool or increased frequency of bowel movements, corresponding to types 6 or 7 on the Bristol stool scale [Citation14].\n\n3.3.1. Prior to initiating trofinetide\n3.3.1.1. Recommendation 1\nObtain a 7- day baseline of bowel activity (stool frequency and consistency, presence of blood) and provide caregiver education on diarrhea management before initiation of trofinetide. A 7- day daily bowel record should be sufficient to document a typical elimination pattern. Stool consistency may be subject to the interpretation of the caregiver or family. While the Bristol stool scale [Citation14] is appropriate for research and possibly caregivers, practical comparisons may be helpful for describing stool texture. For example, it may help to ask caregivers whether the stool is shaped like a ball or pebble, stringy, or formed like a log. Blood in stool should be evaluated to rule out a side infection or fissures from constipation and should prompt a general pediatric or gastroenterology consultation.\n\n3.3.2. Upon initiation of trofinetide\n3.3.2.1. Recommendation 2\nUpon the start of trofinetide, stop or reduce all constipation medications. This recommendation allows flexibility for stopping or reducing constipation medications to avoid a lapse into a diarrhea routine in susceptible individuals. When there is a history of severe constipation, a gastroenterology consultation may be warranted. Caregiver input should be considered as to whether constipation or diarrhea is more problematic. Some clinicians may also prefer adjusting the approach to constipation management during an up-titration of trofinetide. Strategies may include suppositories or enemas, as needed, in place of daily medications.\n\n3.3.2.2. Recommendation 3\nAt initiation of trofinetide, examine any concomitant medications and switch as many liquid medications that contain sugar alcohols as possible to pill form. Many sugar alcohols have a laxative effect [Citation15], and the altered gut microbiome in individuals with RTT may influence their susceptibility to diarrhea [Citation16–18], so it is helpful to eliminate any other potential causes of diarrhea during trofinetide treatment.\n\n3.3.2.3. Recommendation 4\nStart fiber (e. g. psyllium, wheat dextrin, flaxseed) as a stool normalizer when starting trofinetide. Recommended dosing for children is 0.5–1 tsp 1–3 times daily in 4 oz water; for adolescents/adults, 1–2 tsp 1–4 times daily in 8 oz water. Continue fiber to promote bowel health, even in the absence of diarrhea or diarrhea resolution. A proactive approach to diarrhea prevention is advised, considering the rates of diarrhea TEAEs in trials. In the authors’ experience, prophylactic fiber appears to be more acceptable to families compared with prophylactic loperamide. Initial gas and bloating may be experienced with fiber, which is often temporary [Citation19], so practitioners may adjust fiber as needed. Fiber is often used to improve stool consistency in the setting of either diarrhea or constipation [Citation20], so taking fiber with trofinetide may help in this regard. For this reason, fiber should be continued, assuming it is well tolerated, regardless of diarrhea status.\n\n3.3.3. Upon occurrence of diarrhea\n3.3.3.1. Recommendation 5\nAt the onset of diarrhea, start oral loperamide according to the dosing instructions by age and weight in Table 2, using the lowest effective dose of loperamide that maintains symptomatic control. For example, one might start with a dose every 8 hours but, through trial and error, find that once- or twice-daily dosing suffices. Even a single daily dose may be effective for diarrhea management.\n\nIf no bowel movement occurs for 24 hours, withhold loperamide until a bowel movement occurs. If bloody diarrhea occurs, loperamide is contraindicated and should not be used. Prophylactic use of loperamide upon initiation of trofinetide is not recommended due to concerns over unnecessarily inducing impaction. Although loperamide is not recommended when the cause of diarrhea is unknown, it is helpful in the management of trofinetide-induced diarrhea. (There is resistance to the use of loperamide for diarrhea of unknown causes because it may cause accumulation of the infectious agent if gastroenteritis is the cause of diarrhea.)\n\nOther antidiarrheal medications to consider include bismuth [Citation21] and cholestyramine. Families may prefer milder forms of antidiarrheal treatment such as bismuth subsalicylate for short-term use. Like other medications containing salicylate, it must be avoided in those with chicken pox exposure or illness [Citation22]. Anticholinergic medication may be considered for severe cramping. Caregivers should consult with the individual’s gastroenterologist to address the use of other antidiarrheal medications and cramping. For unresolved diarrhea, the duration of antidiarrheal treatment and other management approaches may be determined through close collaboration with the individual’s gastroenterologist.\n\n3.3.3.2. Recommendation 6\nIf diarrhea occurs, ask the caregiver to contact the prescriber and to begin tracking the consistency and frequency of bowel movements or occurrence of new fecal incontinence. Frequency and consistency of stool are key characteristics to capture in the diarrhea event diary. ‘New fecal incontinence’ is included in consideration of those who may lose bowel control with trofinetide treatment. In the authors’ experience, most individuals with RTT are not fully continent at baseline, although they may be ‘time-trained.’ For individuals who are trained, development of fecal incontinence may be a deterrent to continued treatment.\n\nHydration status should be monitored by the caregiver as well as the clinician, but it is not necessary to track with diarrhea events. Caregivers should track hydration status by monitoring fluid intake, moisture of mucus membranes, presence of tears (if crying), voiding frequency during the daytime, and any deviance from the normal voiding routine. Consistency and frequency of stool should provide information for assessing hydration.\n\nThe presence of visible blood is not anticipated for trofinetide-induced diarrhea. As noted above, visible blood in the stool should prompt a general pediatric or gastroenterology visit.\n\nIf diarrhea persists despite discontinuation of constipation medications and initiation of fiber, a 50% dose reduction of trofinetide may be considered. Following diarrhea resolution, trofinetide may be titrated back to the full dose.\n\n3.3.4. Other\n3.3.4.1. Recommendation 7\nIf hydration status is normal, the individual with RTT should continue a regular diet: regular milk, yogurt, complex carbohydrates (e. g. bread, potatoes, rice, wheat), fruits, vegetables, and lean meats are recommended [Citation23]. High-fat foods should be avoided, and a low-fat diet, rather than a bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT) diet, is preferred, since BRAT is considered to be unsuitable for diarrhea management [Citation23,Citation24]. Food should be provided in smaller and more frequent volumes. Fruit juice should be given at half-strength (i. e. mixed with an equal amount of water).\n\nTo ensure adequate hydration, review daily fluid requirements and intake in light of potential increased fluid output due to diarrhea. Total daily fluid requirements are calculated on an individual basis with the recommendation that caregivers meet at least 80% of their child’s total daily fluid needs. Hypernatremia can occur due to diarrhea, which may be avoided by calculating and providing adequate fluid to counter the fluid output with diarrhea.\n\nCaregivers should also monitor for dehydration. Signs of mild dehydration include increased thirst, a slightly dry mouth, and slightly decreased urination [Citation23]. Moderate or severe dehydration signs include dry mouth, significantly decreased urination, lack of tears, and sunken eyes [Citation23]. Because urinary retention may occur in individuals with RTT [Citation25], a duration for decreased urine output is not specified.\n\nFor mild dehydration, administer an oral rehydration solution (e. g. Pedialyte® or generic) at 5 tsp/lb, given over 4 hours. Small volumes of the dose can be given as frequently as every few minutes or as tolerated. The prescriber should be contacted in the event of moderate or severe dehydration.\n\n3.3.4.2. Recommendation 8\nIf the individual has stopped constipation medications and does not have diarrhea or a bowel movement for 24 hours, regular constipation medications may be resumed as needed, similar to the recommended timeframe for withholding loperamide."},{"role":"assistant","content":"One week before trofinetide\nTracking stool frequency (how often) and consistency (shape, hardness/softness) will establish a baseline for daily bowel activityū Consider practical comparisons for stool consistency: shaped like a ball or pebble, stringy, formed like a log.\nBlood in stool should prompt a consultation with a general pediatrician or gastroenterologist to rule out infection or fissure from constipation\n\nAt start of trofinetide\nStop or reduce constipation medications with healthcare provider inputū Caregivers should indicate whether constipation or diarrhea is more problematic for them.\nIf possible, have healthcare provider switch liquid medications that have sugar alcohols to pill formū Many sugar alcohols have a laxative effect (promote bowel movements).\nFiber promotes bowel health and stool consistencyū Thus, fiber should be continued regardless of diarrhea.\nFiber can be psyllium, wheat dextrin, or flaxseedū For children: 0.5–1 tsp in 4 oz water, 1–3 times dailyū For adolescents/adults: 1–2 tsp in 8 oz water, 1–4 times daily\n\nAt first sign of diarrhea\nWith healthcare provider consult, start loperamide for diarrhea, using lowest effective doseū If no bowel movement for 24 hours, stop loperamide until a bowel movement occursū Loperamide should not be used for bloody diarrhea.\nConsult with healthcare provider for other antidiarrheal medications (bismuth subsalicylate, cholestyramine) and cramping ū Bismuth subsalicylate should not be used in those with chicken pox.\nTracking stool frequency and consistency will aid in adjusting the diarrhea management plan.\nHydration tracking: monitor fluid intake, dry mouth, increased thirst, tears (if crying), daytime urination and stooling frequency, change in normal urination and stooling routine.\nIf diarrhea persists despite these measures, ask healthcare provider about reducing trofinetide dose by half"}]}

Two subtypes of C3G are distinguished by electron microscopic examination of kidney biopsy based on the location and density of deposits, namely dense deposit disease and C3GN. Previously, C3G was classified as a subtype of membranoproliferative GN (MPGN); however, a better understanding of pathogenesis has led to the reclassification of MPGN immunoglobulin-associated (immune complex-MPGN), with glomerular IgG and C3 deposits, and C3G, with predominant C3 deposits. Both entities share overlapping pathophysiological features, with AP dysregulation found in both immune complex-MPGN and C3G.\n\nThe onset of C3G is typically seen in children and young adults with approximately 50% of patients progressing to kidney failure within 10 years of diagnosis, although cases of more rapid progression are not unusual. Patients require maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation following the development of terminal kidney failure; however, there is a substantial risk of disease recurrence post-transplant, with allograft loss reported in about 50% of patients at 5 years post-transplantation. Though C3G carries one of the highest risks for kidney failure of all primary glomerular diseases, there are currently no approved therapies targeting the underlying cause of the disease.\n\nThe complement system, triggered by 1 of 3 initiating pathways (the classical, lectin, and APs), plays an integral role in innate immunity and serves as a first line of defense against foreign pathogens. Unlike the other 2 pathways, the AP is constitutively active at a low level, making it particularly susceptible to dysregulation. The AP also plays a pivotal role in amplifying the complement response and ultimately accounts for more than 80% of terminal pathway activation regardless of the activating pathway.\n\nDysregulation of the AP in the fluid phase underlies the pathogenesis of C3G. The consequence is C3 glomerular deposition within the glomeruli, which triggers inflammation and glomerular injury. Genetic factors such as mutations in complement proteins or their regulators, and/or autoantibodies against complement components or nephritic factors that stabilize the convertases, drive this complement dysregulation. Evidence from mouse models has provided important insights into the role of AP overactivation in C3G pathogenesis. Mice deficient in factor H (Cfh−/−), a negative regulator of C3 convertase, develop a C3G-like phenotype whereas mice lacking both Cfh and Cfb, which encodes complement factor B (FB), a key regulator of the AP, do not. In addition, though C5 deficiency in Cfh-/- mice reduces renal inflammation and tissue damage, it does not prevent C3 deposition, an observation consistent with the role C5 plays in the terminal but not the initiating pathway of the complement cascade. These observations demonstrate that targeting AP activation, by inhibiting or preventing the formation of C3 convertase, is an attractive therapeutic strategy to ameliorate C3G disease progression.\n\nIptacopan is an oral, first-in-class, and highly potent selective inhibitor of FB that efficiently blocks the AP. FB includes a serine protease domain (Bb), which is the proteolytically active component of the AP C3 (C3bBb) and C5 (C3bBb3b) convertases (see Figure 1 and Supplementary Video for further information). As a consequence, iptacopan-mediated inhibition of FB suppresses C3 convertase activity, blocking the cleavage of C3 and activation of the amplification loop. In turn, this blockade prevents downstream generation of the C5 convertase complex and triggering of the terminal complement cascade and its effector consequences, which include opsonization, formation of the potent C5a anaphylatoxin and generation of membrane attack complex."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Complement 3 glomerulopathy, known as C3G, is an extremely rare disease that affects the kidneys. On average, 2 to 3 out of every 1 million people have C3G. It often starts in children and young adults. C3G is caused by a problem with a part of the body’s immune system called the complement system. This system is made up of a large number of proteins that work with each other to fight infections caused by viruses and bacteria. Complement component 3, known as C3, is a protein that has an important role within the complement system. It is broken down into smaller pieces that can help the immune system to fight infections. Glomerulopathy means damage to the part of the kidney that filters the blood to make urine, known as the glomerulus (glomeruli is the plural wording). The complement system can be activated in three different ways, known as pathways. One of these pathways is called the alternative pathway. In people with C3G, the alternative pathway is overactive and too much C3 is broken down. The broken-down pieces can become stuck in the kidneys, where they cause damage to the glomeruli. This damage means that the glomeruli cannot filter the blood as well as usual, so less urine is made, and blood or protein may leak into the urine. What is complement 3 glomerulopathy? Why is the complement system overactive in people with C3G? There are a few different reasons: Some people may have genetic changes in proteins that help to keep the complement system under control. Some people may have abnormal proteins that interfere with the proteins that keep the complement system under control. For most people with C3G, the reason why their alternative pathway is overactive is not clear. The main symptoms of C3G are blood leaking into the urine (hematuria) or protein leaking into the urine (proteinuria). When people with C3G lose large amounts of protein in the urine, fluid can build up elsewhere in the body, such as the hands, feet, and ankles, which causes swelling. As the kidneys become more damaged over time, other symptoms may develop. What is iptacopan? APPEAR-C3G will study a new medicine called iptacopan, which is in development for the treatment of people with C3G. Iptacopan is a capsule that is taken twice a day by mouth. Earlier studies found that treatment with iptacopan may: Reduce the build-up of C3 pieces in the kidneys. Improve the kidneys’ ability to filter blood and reduce the amount of protein in the urine. Iptacopan is designed to work by blocking a protein called factor B that is involved in the alternative pathway: Factor B is part of a protein called C3 convertase that breaks down C3 into pieces called C3a and C3b. Iptacopan is designed to stop factor B from working, which stops C3 from breaking down. Stopping C3 from breaking down stops the alternative pathway of the complement system from being overactive and can stop C3 pieces from becoming stuck in the kidneys."}]}

Patients’ treating physicians determine clinical assessments and care of enrolled patients, and the physicians voluntarily provide data on assessments of the clinical manifestations, GD progression and response to therapy.\n\nThis study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects at the time of enrollment in the Registry. The data are reported in accordance with STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines.\n\nStudy population\nPatients included in the study met all of the following criteria: (1) diagnosed with GD1 as determined by the participating Registry physician, (2) a known diagnosis date, a recorded birthdate, and a last follow-up date, (3) first primary therapy was imiglucerase, (4) had known splenectomy status and, if splenectomized, the date of the splenectomy was recorded, (5) at least one skeletal assessment recorded, and (6) if a fracture was reported, a date of fracture was recorded. All patients who met these inclusion criteria comprised the total study population for descriptive analyses.\n\nFor the risk factor analysis population, the sample was limited to patients with first fractures occurring after imiglucerase treatment initiation and in adulthood (age≥18 years) as well as patients who did not experience a fracture during follow-up. Patients whose follow-up ended prior to 18 years of age or who experienced a fracture prior to treatment initiation or in childhood (age<18 years) were excluded from the risk factor analysis. The GRAF score is a tool to be used with bone density measurement and other modifiable, non-GD-specific risk factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol intake, frailty) to inform physicians and previously untreated GD1 patients about risk for a future fracture after starting imiglucerase or presumably, other alternative ERTS. GRAF scoring can also help predict the extent that fracture risk increases if initiation of treatment is deferred by either physician judgment or patient choice. Better prevention of serious bone complications is currently recognized as an unmet need for patients with GD1. When considering initiation of treatment, it is useful to know to what extent fixed patient-specific factors determine risk for future fractures beyond standard risk factors that change with time and treatment such as decreased bone mineral density. As similar risk factors determine the risk of post-treatment osteonecrosis, a risk-score based on the principles outlined in this paper could be applied to the likelihood of major bone events occurring: a combination of fracture and osteonecrosis, the two most impactful and feared complications of GD."},{"role":"assistant","content":"To find out how good the GRAF was at predicting fractures in adulthood, researchers looked at information (data) on people with GD1 from a database called the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) Gaucher Registry. The published data from this registry was anonymised, meaning no one could be identified in the study. The researchers used historical data from people who had previously received treatment with ERTs (imiglucerase or alglucerase) as their first treatment for GD1 (although alglucerase is no longer available as a treatment). These data would help the researchers understand if any factors, such as delaying starting treatment, were likely to increase someone’s chance of having a fracture, even though they were receiving an ERT. As they wanted to understand the chance of a fracture in adulthood, the researchers did not include information from people who had a first fracture before the age of 18 years. It is useful for doctors and researchers to know if the GRAF is effective at assessing fracture risk because of the following reasons. The underlying reasons for fractures in people with GD1 are different from those that lead to fractures in the general population. People with GD1 often have thinning of their bones and can have problems with the shape, form, and strength of their bones that make them more likely to have a fracture, in particular hip and spine fractures, compared with people who do not have GD1. Fractures may also take longer to heal and are less likely to fully repair in people with GD1 (although modern bone surgery to fix fractures is generally successful). Because of these reasons, it is helpful to have an assessment that is specifically for those with GD1. It might be useful when other assessments, such as bone scans, are not available. It might help doctors and people with GD1 make decisions about starting treatment with an ERT earlier."}]}

Resulting abnormal accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes leads to cellular dysfunction; progressive respiratory failure due to muscle weakness, cardiac anomalies, abnormal skeletal muscle morphology, and damage to smooth muscles with related functional disabilities; significant morbidity; and premature age of death in many patients. While all patients eventually exhibit progressive muscle weakness, Pompe disease manifests as a broad clinical spectrum of phenotypes with considerable variation in age of symptom onset, presenting signs/symptoms, degree of severity, organ involvement, and rate of progression. Patients with the most severe form, classic infantile Pompe disease, have onset of symptoms ≤ 12 months of age, often within the first days to weeks of life, with progressive cardiomyopathy, decreased respiratory function due to muscle weakness, muscle hypotonia, and death in infancy. Cardiomyopathy is a cardinal feature of classic infantile Pompe disease. In other patients, symptoms, including progressive skeletal muscle weakness affecting mobility and leading to respiratory failure, evolve as a continuum of disease, presenting as early as ≤ 12 months of age without significant cardiac involvement, or later during early childhood through late adulthood, sometimes as late as the 6th decade of life.\n\n1.2 The GAA gene and Pompe disease\nThe GAA gene is responsible for the production of GAA protein. The occurrence of different pathogenic variants within the GAA gene causing various levels of GAA enzyme deficiency and abnormal enzyme activity influences disease severity and manifestations across the disease spectrum and is a primary contributing factor to the considerable variation seen in age of presentation, severity, and rate of progression. Complete deficiency of the GAA enzyme, resulting in enzyme activity < 1% of normal, is associated with classic infantile Pompe disease. Residual enzyme activity is more variable in other patient groups, and generally is not more than 30% of normal. To date, more than 400 pathogenic variants, in addition to numerous benign variants and variants of unknown significance (VUS), in the GAA gene have been reported. Confounding genetic and nongenetic factors not yet identified seem to contribute to the clinical diversity seen in phenotypes, including among family members with the same pathogenic GAA genotypes. A common aspect for these patients is the presence of at least one variant supporting the production of some residual GAA activity.\n\nIdentification of variants in the GAA gene provides valuable information for confirming diagnosis or carrier status; determining variant-phenotype and genotype–phenotype correlations; and genetic counseling. In addition, when standard biochemical assays are not available, sequence variant identification may be used to predict cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, which can influence treatment decisions.\n\n1.3 The Pompe Registry\nThe Pompe Registry is a long-term, multinational, and observational program designed to improve understanding of the natural history and outcomes of patients with Pompe disease. It started in 2004 and is sponsored and administered by Sanofi Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease can be enrolled by physician investigators worldwide regardless of age, clinical manifestations, or treatment status. Participation by physicians and patients is completely voluntary. Patients provide appropriate written informed consent for their health information to be submitted to the Registry and for their data to be used in aggregate analyses. Treating physicians determine the frequency and type of assessments according to the individual patient's need for standard medical care and follow-up. This detailed patient information is collected in the Pompe Registry database. Because of the voluntary and observational nature of the program, the frequency and types of assessments reported for each patient will vary. Physicians can report their patients’ characteristics, including gender; age; clinical characteristics; and diagnostic parameters, including methods of diagnosis and the results of enzymatic and genetic testing. The Pompe Registry can be accessed only by participating physicians. In accordance with the consent provided by patients, information gathered in the Pompe Registry can only be shared to the general public through peer-reviewed publications. This is also the mechanism by which the Registry can provide information for other genetic and phenotype databases. The Pompe Registry is the largest global repository of data for Pompe disease and a valuable resource for the medical community."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is this summary about? This is a summary of an article originally published in the journal Human Mutation. Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder. In the USA, one person in every 10,000 to 28,000 people is born with Pompe disease. Pompe disease develops when both parents pass on a copy of a gene, called GAA, that has a disease-causing change to it. The GAA gene contains the instructions to make an enzyme called acid alpha glucosidase; abbreviated as ‘GAA’, which breaks down glycogen into glucose. When the GAA gene contains a disease-causing change, this can lead to a total absence of GAA or the enzyme failing to function properly. As a result, glycogen builds up in cells and causes damage to organs such as the heart and muscles. There is a wide range of severity and symptoms in Pompe disease, including muscle weakness, heart and breathing issues, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). There are many changes in the GAA gene (called variants) that can result in Pompe disease. The severity of symptoms and when symptoms start partly depend on the variants that the people with Pompe disease have inherited from their parents.\n\nWhat was learned and how? Researchers looked at GAA gene variants from people with Pompe disease using a database called the Pompe Registry. Since 2004, the Pompe Registry has collected worldwide clinical information on people with Pompe disease and their gene changes. The researchers investigated how many different GAA variants are currently listed in this registry, and how common each variant was overall and in different geographical regions. The researchers assigned the people to three groups based on the age of when their symptoms began and if they had an enlarged heart diagnosed in their first year of life. Out of 1753 people enrolled in the Pompe Registry, the researchers analyzed data from 1079 people from 26 countries. 2075 GAA gene variants were identified, 80 of which had not been reported before. A harmful variant called c.-32-13T>G was the most common overall and was present in North America, Latin America and Europe.\n\nWhat are the practical implications? This analysis supports healthcare professionals and people with Pompe disease to appreciate the geographic distribution and to assess the nature of GAA variants. The findings can help with the diagnosis of Pompe disease and the understanding of how different variants relate to the start and severity of symptoms. This information will also help genetic counsellors and doctors to have discussions with people with Pompe disease and their families and caregivers about genetic risk and family planning."}]}

Normalizing cortisol production is the primary treatment goal.\n\nObjective\nWe aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of osilodrostat, a potent, orally available 11βhydroxylase inhibitor, compared with placebo in patients with Cushing disease.\n\nMethods\nLINC 4 was a phase III, multicenter trial comprising an initial 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (osilodrostat:placebo, 2:1) period followed by a 36-week, open-label treatment period (NCT02697734). Adult patients (aged 18-75 years) with confirmed Cushing disease and mean urinary free cortisol (mUFC) excretion ≥ 1.3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were eligible. The primary endpoint was the proportion of randomized patients with mUFC ≤ ULN at week 12. The key secondary endpoint was the proportion achieving mUFC ≤ ULN at week 36 (after 24 weeks’ open-label osilodrostat).\n\nResults\nSeventy-three patients (median age, 39 years [range, 19-67]; mean/median mUFC, 3.1 × ULN/2.5 × ULN) received randomized treatment with osilodrostat (n = 48) or placebo (n = 25). At week 12, significantly more osilodrostat (77%) than placebo (8%) patients achieved mUFC ≤ ULN (odds ratio 43.4; 95% CI 7.1, 343.2; P < 0.0001). Response was maintained at week 36, when 81% (95% CI 69.9, 89.1) of all patients achieved mUFC ≤ ULN. The most common adverse events during the placebo-controlled period (osilodrostat vs placebo) were decreased appetite (37.5% vs 16.0%), arthralgia (35.4% vs 8.0%), and nausea (31.3% vs 12.0%).\n\nConclusion\nOsilodrostat rapidly normalized mUFC excretion in most patients with Cushing disease and maintained this effect throughout the study. The safety profile was favorable."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What is Cushing’s syndrome and Cushing’s disease?\n\nEndogenous Cushing’s syndrome is a condition whereby the body produces too much of the hormone cortisol due to different causes (pituitary tumour, adrenal tumour, and other tumours that produce adrenocorticotrophic hormone, a hormone that stimulates cortisol production). Cushing’s disease is a specific type of Cushing’s syndrome in which excess cortisol is caused by a tumour formed in the pituitary gland. People with Cushing’s disease, compared with people without this condition, are at greater risk of other serious illnesses and early death, with signs and symptoms varying between individuals. Based on data from other studies, collectively called the LINC programme, osilodrostat is approved as a treatment taken by mouth for adults with Cushing’s syndrome (in Europe, Switzerland, and Japan), including Cushing’s disease (in the USA).\n\nWhat happened in the LINC 4 study?\n\nThe LINC 4 study looked at osilodrostat in 73 adult participants with Cushing’s disease from 14 countries. The researchers wanted to learn how effective osilodrostat was in patients with Cushing’s disease and what the side effects were. The term ‘side effect’ refers to any effect that a person experienced during the LINC 4 study. Side effects may or may not be caused by osilodrostat.\n\nWhat were the results?\n\nThe study showed that osilodrostat was better than placebo (a dummy sugar pill) at lowering cortisol levels to normal, and that cortisol was then maintained at normal levels during continued treatment with osilodrostat through to week 48 of the study. In addition, signs and symptoms of Cushing’s disease improved during treatment with osilodrostat, including lowered blood pressure, better control of blood sugar, and improved quality of life. The side effects of osilodrostat treatment were generally mild or moderate in severity, and very few study participants stopped taking the drug because of them.\n\nWhat do the results of the study mean?\n\nThese results support osilodrostat as an effective medical treatment for people with Cushing’s disease."}]}

A total of 35 children were enrolled in four sequential cohorts to receive vosoritide at a once-daily subcutaneous dose of 2.5 μg per kilogram of body weight (8 patients in cohort 1), 7.5 μg per kilogram (8 patients in cohort 2), 15.0 μg per kilogram (10 patients in cohort 3), or 30.0 μg per kilogram (9 patients in cohort 4). After 6 months, the dose in cohort 1 was increased to 7.5 μg per kilogram and then to 15.0 μg per kilogram, and in cohort 2, the dose was increased to 15.0 μg per kilogram; the patients in cohorts 3 and 4 continued to receive their initial doses. At the time of data cutoff, the 24-month dose-finding study had been completed, and 30 patients had been enrolled in an ongoing long-term extension study; the median duration of follow-up across both studies was 42 months. RESULTS During the treatment periods in the dose-finding and extension studies, adverse events occurred in 35 of 35 patients (100%), and serious adverse events occurred in 4 of 35 patients (11%). Therapy was discontinued in 6 patients (in 1 because of an adverse event). During the first 6 months of treatment, a dose-dependent increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed with vosoritide up to a dose of 15.0 μg per kilogram, and a sustained increase in the annualized growth velocity was observed at doses of 15.0 and 30.0 μg per kilogram for up to 42 months."},{"role":"assistant","content":"All 35 children experienced mild side effects when taking vosoritide. 4 children experienced serious health complications during the study.

The study was conducted at 21 sites in ten countries. Ataluren was manufactured by PTC Therapeutics International Limited (Dublin, Ireland) and was supplied by PTC Therapeutics at all study sites. The primary objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of ataluren at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg in the morning, 10 mg/kg at midday and 20 mg/kg in the evening) in patients with nmDMD. Secondary objectives explored the long-term efficacy of ataluren and included measuring the ages at LoA and decline in respiratory function (i.e., to defined FVC events). Respiratory function was only evaluated in nonambulatory patients (i.e., throughout the study for those who were nonambulatory upon entering the study, or once the patient had lost ambulation for those who were ambulatory at study start and transitioned to a nonambulatory status during the study). Of note, patients who were nonambulatory at study entry had previously received ataluren in a clinical trial during which they were ambulatory.\n\nStudy design and data collection methodology for the CINRG DNHS have been described in full previously. The study enrolled patients with DMD (i.e., various DMD genotypes; not only those with nmDMD) aged 2–28 years at 20 centers in nine countries between 2006 and 2016. Because Study 019 did not contain a placebo control arm, data from patients receiving SoC in the CINRG DNHS are used in the present analysis as a control to provide context for assessing the effects of ataluren plus SoC in Study 019 patients. Here, SoC refers to corticosteroid and palliative therapies.\n\nPatient eligibility & enrollment Study 019 Eligible patients were males with nmDMD who had a history of exposure to ataluren in a prior PTC Therapeutics-sponsored study in nmDMD. The largest recruitment pool for Study 019 consisted of patients who had completed the prior randomized, controlled, Phase IIb study of 48 weeks’ duration (Study 007) and the subsequent open-label extension study (Study 007e). Patients who had participated in the Phase IIa study (Study 004) and the subsequent open-label extension study (Study 004e) were also included in the trial. One patient did not have previous exposure to ataluren and entered Study 019 through an institutional review board (IRB)- and US FDA-approved special exemption.\n\nCINRG DNHS Patient eligibility for the CINRG DNHS has been described previously. Briefly, patients aged 2–4 years were required to have a diagnosis of DMD confirmed by one or more of the following: dystrophin immunofluorescence, dystrophin immunoblot, an out-of-frame deletion or complete DMD gene sequencing in the proband or sibling. Patients aged 5–28 years were required to meet the same criteria or to have documented clinical symptoms of DMD. Direct support of the diagnosis by either a positive DNA analysis, a muscle biopsy showing abnormal dystrophin, or a combination of increased CK levels and an X-linked pedigree was also required. In total, 440 patients were enrolled in the CINRG DNHS. Patients were excluded from the present analyses if they received investigational drugs in previous clinical trials.\n\nStatistical analyses Study populations The as-treated population in Study 019 included all patients who received at least one dose of ataluren. Study 019 patients were considered ambulatory if they had a 10-m walk/run time of 30 s or less at screening and nonambulatory if their 10-m walk/run time was more than 30 s at screening. Nonambulatory patients from the CINRG DNHS were defined as such when they self-reported full-time wheelchair use. Data for continuous and categorical variables are presented descriptively. Ataluren treatment at 40 mg/kg/day plus SoC was associated with a significant delay of approximately 2.2 years in age at LoA compared with SoC alone in the CINRG DNHS study. The median age at LoA for the 60 patients treated with ataluren 40 mg/kg/day plus SoC in Study 019 was 15.5 years, compared with 13.3 years in the matched CINRG DNHS cohort. Data generated from a sensitivity analysis, in which age at diagnosis was used as the fourth covariate for propensity score matching for both Study 019 and CINRG DNHS patient populations, yielded similar results: the median age at LoA was 15.5 and 12.0 years for Study 019 and CINRG DNHS cohorts, respectively. Ataluren treatment (40 mg/kg/day) plus SoC resulted in a 3.0-year delay in patients’ predicted FVC declining to <60% compared with SoC alone. In the matched populations, 23 of 45 (51.1%) patients in Study 019 and 32 of 45 (71.1%) patients in the CINRG DNHS experienced a decline to below the 60% predicted FVC threshold. The median age for this milestone was 18.1 years in Study 019 and 15.1 years in the CINRG DNHS. Under the current standard of care, DMD remains a disease with devastating consequences and a poor prognosis, with survival to the fourth decade of life for a small fraction of patients. As shown in this study, ataluren treatment was associated with a delay in the age at LoA and decline in respiratory function in patients with nmDMD. The respiratory findings extend prior results that were primarily in ambulatory patients and indicate that ataluren also demonstrates treatment benefit in nonambulatory patients. The progressive and irreversible effects of DMD underscore the importance of early intervention with treatments that have the potential to slow physical deterioration and delay the natural course of this fatal disease, which is considered an important treatment benefit in the DMD patient community. The delay in loss of motor function associated with ataluren is not only clinically important but is highly meaningful to patients and their families since the loss of a physical function in DMD is irreversible."},{"role":"assistant","content":"What was the aim of this analysis?\nThe aim of this analysis was to find out more about the effect of ataluren in participants with nmDMD for the duration of the study, especially relating to the age at loss of walking ability and the age at decline in lung function beyond a certain critical level.\nThe present analysis aimed to determine the effect of ataluren by comparing participants with nmDMD from Study 019 with patients with DMD from the CINRG DNHS. In the CINRG DNHS, participants were given SoC, including corticosteroids, but were not given ataluren. For this analysis, participants from the two studies were matched to one another based on common predictors of disease progression, such as the age at which they first experienced symptoms. To determine the effectiveness of the drug, doctors measured the participants’ walking ability. If a participant took longer than 30 seconds to run or walk 10 meters, this was recorded as loss of walking ability. Similarly, lung function was studied by measuring the maximum volume of air that the participants could forcibly exhale from their lungs, which is called the forced vital capacity (FVC). Patients with DMD whose FVC has decreased to below 60% of their predicted lung function are usually at the later stages of the disease. Patients at this point require mechanical support with breathing to help preserve their lung function.\nAge at loss of walking ability Participants who were treated with ataluren and SoC lost their walking ability later in life than participants who were treated with SoC only. • The average age at which participants lost their ability to walk was 15.5 years for participants with nmDMD from Study 019 (treated with ataluren and SoC) and 13.3 years for participants with DMD from the CINRG DNHS (treated with SoC only). • These results were calculated based on the data from 60 matched participants from each study. Age at decline in lung function beyond a certain critical level The lung function of participants who were treated with ataluren and SoC got worse later in life than that of participants who were treated with SoC only. • The average age at which patients’ lung function declined to an FVC of less than 60% of their predicted lung function was 18.1 years for patients with nmDMD from Study 019 (treated with ataluren and SoC) and 15.1 years for patients with DMD from the CINRG DNHS (treated with SoC only). • These results were calculated based on the data from 45 matched participants from each study.\nWhat were the main conclusions from this analysis?\nIn this analysis, ataluren treatment in addition to SoC was shown to delay the age at which participants with nmDMD lost their walking ability and experienced a decline in lung function beyond a certain critical level compared with SoC alone in participants with DMD. The findings from this analysis support previous results showing that ataluren treatment in combination with SoC can delay important signs of disease progression in patients with nmDMD."}]}

This results in progressive, lifelong accumulation of glycosphingolipids, in particular globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and the deacylated form globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-GL-3), in plasma, urine and a wide range of cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, all kidney cell types, cardiomyocytes, and neural cells. Progressive cell and tissue damage leads to fibrosis and dysfunction of vital organs. Currently, more than 900 different variations in the GLA gene have been reported, and most Fabry families have unique variants with intra-familial variability in clinical expression. Hemizygous male patients with the severe, ‘classic’ Fabry phenotype start developing symptoms in early childhood, including neuropathic pain, autonomic dysfunction, gastrointestinal complaints, angiokeratomas, and hypohidrosis. Potentially life-threatening complications involving the kidneys and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems may gradually become apparent during adulthood. In heterozygous female patients, the spectrum of clinical phenotypes is broad and depends on the GLA variant and the X-chromosome inactivation pattern in tissues. Both factors influence the level of residual α-Gal activity in female patients, which can range from almost completely absent to normal. Therefore, female patients can be severely affected, present with a more attenuated course, or remain fully asymptomatic. Registry studies have shown that left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), Fabry nephropathy, and ischaemic stroke are prevalent among female Fabry patients, although cardiovascular complications generally develop at older age compared with male patients. Few female patients progress to end-stage kidney disease and, as in male patients, Fabry-related cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in female patients. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant agalsidase (intravenous infusions of either agalsidase beta or agalsidase alfa) is available, and clinical experience now exceeds 15 years. Most of the published studies have reported clinical outcomes in populations primarily composed of male Fabry patients; there is relatively limited data on therapeutic outcomes in female patients. In addition, it is challenging to interpret the long-term treatment benefits for organ-specific outcomes without a treatment-naive comparison group or period. Therefore, the objective of our study was to evaluate cardiomyopathy and kidney function in adult female patients enrolled in the Fabry Registry and to compare the outcomes before and after initiation of treatment with agalsidase beta administered at an average dose of 0.9–1.1 mg/kg every other week (EOW)."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Fabry disease is a rare genetic condition that can affect many parts of the body. It can occur in both males and females. The symptoms of people with Fabry disease tend to get worse over time. People have Fabry disease when they inherit at least one Fabry gene called ‘GLA’ containing an error (or GLA gene error). The GLA gene contains the instructions that cells need to produce an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase (α-Gal for short). α-Gal breaks down certain types of fats called glycolipids, such as globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), that are stored in lysosomes inside cells. People who inherit a GLA gene error have either reduced or no α-Gal activity (which means that it does not work properly). This leads to a build-up of GL-3 and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-GL-3) inside cells and organs in the body, especially in the kidneys, heart, cells of the nervous system, and the cells that line blood vessels. People who have Fabry disease usually have high amounts of GL-3 and lyso-GL-3 in their blood and urine. There are two types of Fabry disease: ‘Classic’ Fabry disease – symptoms start in childhood or adolescence. Later-onset Fabry disease – symptoms start later in life (between the ages of 30 and 70 years). Symptoms are generally less severe than in classic Fabry disease in both sexes. Although both males and females can have Fabry disease, it is generally more severe in males and symptoms can vary significantly in females. What is a gene? A section of DNA that contains the instructions needed for cells to make a particular protein. What are enzymes? Proteins that make chemical reactions happen in the body, such as breaking substances down. What are cells? The building blocks of the body. They are responsible for a variety of functions. What are lysosomes? Small recycling centers inside cells, in which enzymes break down substances that the body does not need. Plain Language Summary of Publication Wanner, Feldt-Rasmussen and Ortiz.\n\nWhy does Fabry disease affect males and females differently? The GLA gene is found on the X chromosome, which is a sex chromosome. There are two types of sex chromosomes, called X and Y. Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (also called XY). Females have two X chromosomes (also called XX). If males inherit an X chromosome with a GLA gene error, all of their cells will have low α-Gal activity and they will develop Fabry disease. If females inherit an X chromosome with a GLA gene error, each cell will have one working GLA gene and one GLA gene error. Although females have two X chromosomes, only one GLA gene produces α-Gal because one X chromosome is randomly ‘turned off’ while the female is an embryo (i.e., first few weeks of gestation). This process is called X chromosome inactivation. An X chromosome with a GLA gene error may be ‘turned off’ in some cells but ‘turned on’ in other cells. This can result in different levels of Fabry disease symptoms in different cells and organs in the same person. As the process of turning off an X chromosome is random, different females can have different cells and organs that are affected by the gene error. What are chromosomes? A substance inside cells that carries genes. Chromosomes are organized in 23 pairs in humans. The 23rd pair comprises two sex chromosomes. Males have one X and one Y chromosome and females have two X chromosomes."}]}
