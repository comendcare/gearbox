Additionally, it offers a variety of value-added services including, but not limited to, the provision of rescue medication, ancillary supplies, direct to site delivery, and products for analytical testing or the preclinical phase.\n\nFurthermore, Novitan plays a crucial role in unmet medical needs programs. The company provides physicians with access to medicines that are not available in their respective countries. This could refer to early access to experimental medications or commercial medicines that have not been marketed in those specific regions. The foundation of this aspect of the business hinges on the principle of 'patient first'. This service is often referred to by terms such as 'name patient', 'expanded access', 'early access', or 'compassionate use'.\n\nDespite the lack of specified year of establishment or headquarters, Novitan operates in the mid-sized business category, with a total trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue falling within the 10-100M range.",

    "description": "Established in 1998, Across Barriers is a small-scale business headquartered in Saarbrücken, Saarland, DE. The company is dedicated to offering novel technologies and services for the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and chemical industries, specifically within the research and development sector. \n\nAcross Barriers specializes in the use of in-vitro models of cell and tissue systems, simulating the transport of substances and formulations across biological barriers. As a result, valuable insights can be drawn regarding permeability and absorption. The company's services range from 3D cell culture, API physical characteristics, and API stress testing studies to solubility studies and real-time stability tests. \n\nThese comprehensive studies provide several benefits to the clients of Across Barriers. Early-stage identification of substances unsuitable for development leads to significant reduction in time and financial costs. The use of in-vitro models also minimizes the need for high-cost, ethically problematic animal experiments. Furthermore, these models allow the classification of formulations that can be administered via innovative forms such as inhalation aerosols or transdermal application, and enable mechanistic conclusions on the in-vivo behavior of substances. \n\nAcross Barriers maintains laboratories for biological and radioactive operations and has permission to work with narcotics agents since 2003. It also provides strategies to help generic companies reduce or avoid clinical studies and provides methods for classifying substances consistent with the BCS guidelines regulated by the FDA. \n\nBy using tissue and cell cultures in pre-clinic research, Across Barriers represents a progressive and innovative step towards faster, safer, and more cost-effective development of modern active substances and formulations. This gives its clients a competitive edge in forward-looking technology.",
